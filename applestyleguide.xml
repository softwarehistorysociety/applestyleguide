<SH3 id="LinkTarget_4527">Conventions used in this guide</SH3>

<Body>Modifiers consisting of two or more words are often hyphenated when they precede a noun, but not when they follow the verb as a compound predicate adjective. This guide distinguishes the differences as follows:</Body>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>An entry followed by adj. in parentheses gives the form to be used when the adjective immediately precedes the noun it modifies.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>An entry followed by pred. adj. in parentheses gives the form to be used when the adjective is a predicate adjective. For example:</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<Example>user-friendly (adj.), user friendly (pred. adj.)</Example>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>If a hyphenated compound has no pred. adj. entry, hyphenate the compound wherever it appears in a sentence.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<Body>pathnames  Follow these guidelines to specify the path to a location in the file system:</Body>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Absolute path: An absolute path describes the location of an item starting at the top level, or root, of the user’s file system. In user materials, describe such paths in 
plain English.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<Example>Open TextEdit, located in the Applications folder at the top level of 
the computer.</Example>

<Example>Fonts for all users are stored in the Fonts folder in the Library folder at the top level of the internal disk.</Example>

<List_body_1>For more technical audiences (for example, users who are accustomed to the pathname conventions used in operating systems such as macOS and UNIX), you can use slashes (including a leading slash) to indicate an absolute path. (In developer materials, pathnames are in code font.)</List_body_1>

<Example>Fonts for all users are stored in /Library/Fonts/.</Example>

<List_body_1>You can also use slashes in user materials if the path goes more than two folders deep from the top level of the file system.</List_body_1>

<Example>Place the file in the /System/Library/Keychains/ folder.</Example>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Relative path: If there’s no leading slash, the path is a relative path—that is, relative to some location other than the root folder.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<Example>Make sure the file is in Library/Application Support.</Example>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Home folder: In user materials, use your to indicate that the item being described is in the user’s home folder. Use plain English (no slashes) to describe folders that are just one or two levels deep.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<Example>Your files are saved in your Documents folder.</Example>

<Example>Your fonts are located in the Fonts folder in your Library folder.</Example>

<List_body_1>If the folders go more than two levels deep, you can use slashes to avoid awkward construction and wordiness. (Don’t use a leading slash, because that would indicate that the starting point is at the top level of the startup disk, not the user’s home folder.)</List_body_1>

<Example>Copy the file to Library/Application Support/Address Book/ in your 
home folder.</Example>

<List_body_1>For more technical audiences, you can use a tilde (~) to specify a path within the user’s home folder.</List_body_1>

<Example>The files are saved in ~/Documents.</Example>

<Example>Copy the file to ~/Library/Application Support/Address Book.</Example>

<List_body_1>You can also use an absolute path with the word username in italics.</List_body_1>

<Example>Each user’s files are saved in /Users/username/Documents.</Example>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Terminating slash: A terminating slash indicates that the final element of the path is a folder rather than a file. You can choose whether or not to use a terminating slash, but be consistent within a document.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<Example>You can find the files you’ve downloaded in ~/Library/Mail Downloads/.</Example>

<H1 id="LinkTarget_8892">Writing inclusively</H1>

<Nav1/>

<H2>Overview</H2>

<Nav2/>

<Body>The people who use Apple products reflect the diversity of the world at large. This chapter provides guidelines and tips for how you can write consciously to include everyone.</Body>

<Body>Note: Guidance about inclusive writing may change over time, so check back for updates. Also keep in mind that inclusive language may vary slightly in different locales, so you may need to adapt the principles here to the unique needs of your language or region.</Body>

<H2>General guidelines</H2>

<Nav2/>

<SH3>Think inclusively.</SH3>

<Body>As you write, think about your potential audience, and try to imagine your content from their perspective. Will the words and phrases you use be understood by everyone? Do these words and phrases have any harmful or negative associations?</Body>

<Body>Keep in mind that words can sometimes carry meanings you don’t intend. Be open to learning about the impact of language, and be respectful of those who may receive words differently from how you intended them.</Body>

<SH3>Research words.</SH3>

<Body>Investigating the history and usage of a word can help you decide whether to use it. For example, some common expressions (like grandfathered in) arose from oppressive or exclusionary contexts. If you’re unsure about a word or expression, be sure to research both how it originated and how it’s understood by people now.</Body>

<SH3>Consider the context.</SH3>

<Body>Even if a common word has one negative use that you should avoid, it may still be acceptable in other contexts. For example, although it’s inappropriate to use mute to refer to a person who is nonspeaking, it’s OK to use it to refer to silencing a device. Take context into account when making wording decisions.</Body>

<SH3>Avoid terms that are violent, oppressive, or ableist.</SH3>

<Body>Don’t describe technology using terms that are inherently violent—like kill or hang. Don’t use the terms master and slave, which describe an oppressive human relationship. Finally, don’t use terms like sanity check, which associates mental health with being functional.</Body>

<Body>In general, it’s a good idea to avoid describing software or hardware using human or biological attributes; doing so can lead to unintended hurtful implications.</Body>

<SH3>Avoid idioms and colloquial expressions.</SH3>

<Body>Common sayings—like fall through the cracks, on the same page, or backseat driver—can add flavor to writing, but they can also be difficult to understand for people who are learning the language. If your content is localized, using phrases like these can also make it more difficult to translate.</Body>

<SH3>Don’t use color to convey positive or negative qualities.</SH3>

<Body>Avoid assigning good and bad values to colors (for example, blacklist, white hat hacker, or red team hacker) or using colors as metaphors to convey larger concepts. Use colors only to describe actual colors (for example, black text on a white background, the white point of a display).</Body>

<SH3>Err on the side of caution.</SH3>

<Body>If you’re not sure about a term, but you believe it might be questionable based on your research or feedback from others, then choose a different term. The beauty of language is that there’s usually a term that expresses the meaning you want to convey just as well—or even more clearly.</Body>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_8916">Inclusive representation</H2>

<Nav2/>

<Body>Remember that the people who use Apple products have a broad variety of life experiences, cultures, and backgrounds. When your content depicts people—real or fictional—make sure to represent the diversity of the world.</Body>

<SH3>Use diverse names as examples.</SH3>

<Body>Sometimes you may use names as examples. Include names that reflect a variety of ethnicities and genders.</Body>

<Example>Given name examples: Blair, Etienne, Guillermo, Lee, Mayuri, Priyanka, Shannon, Yen</Example>

<Example>Family name examples: Kawashima, Lai, McNeil, Melnykova, Salinas, Sears, Zhao</Example>

<Body>Also keep in mind that some cultures don’t use a Western-style name structure (given name followed by a family name). In addition, some cultures may use multiple family names. Try to reflect this diversity in your examples.</Body>

<SH3>Avoid biases and stereotypes.</SH3>

<Body>Bias is a tendency to think and behave in ways that are favorable (or unfavorable) to certain people or communities. Be aware of ways your content may unintentionally reinforce biases, and consciously work to avoid doing so. For example:</Body>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>If your content uses text or imagery to depict people in certain occupations or settings, include a variety of ethnicities, genders, ages, body types, and abilities.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>If your content mentions examples of holidays, foods, or sports, don’t just give examples from Western culture.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Avoid using examples that reflect primarily an affluent lifestyle.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<Body>A stereotype is a fixed belief about people or groups based on identifying characteristics, like gender, race, physical capability, or age. Avoid stereotypes in how people are presented in your content. For example, don’t only represent a family as a woman, a man, and their biological children; remember to include a variety of family types.</Body>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_8928">Gender identity</H2>

<Nav2/>

<Body>Because not everyone identifies as male or female, avoid binary representations of gender when you can reword using gender-neutral language.</Body>

<Example>Avoid: Hiring men and women of diverse backgrounds fosters a culture of innovation.</Example>

<Example>Preferable: Hiring people of diverse backgrounds fosters a culture 
of innovation.</Example>

<Body>It’s fine to refer to specific genders if the context requires it.</Body>

<Example>The percentage of female employees has increased.</Example>

<Example>Women should earn the same as men for comparable work.</Example>

<SH3>Use gender-neutral pronouns.</SH3>

<Body>Don’t use gender-specific pronouns (such as he, she, he or she, and so on) to refer to people of unspecified gender. Instead, it’s OK to use they, their, or them as a singular, gender-neutral pronoun.</Body>

<Example>Correct: A subscriber can post their recipes to your shared folder.</Example>

<Example>Incorrect: A subscriber can post his or her recipes to your shared folder.</Example>

<Body>You can also avoid gender-specific pronouns by rewriting a sentence—for example, using the plural form of the noun (subscribers can post their recipes), or simply omitting the pronoun (a subscriber can post recipes).</Body>

<Body>If you refer to a specific person, don’t make assumptions about which pronouns to use based on the person’s name or appearance. If you’re unsure how to refer to someone, 
you can ask them. Individuals may go by he/him, she/her, they/them, other pronouns, 
or no pronouns.</Body>

<SH3>Use gender-neutral titles and honorifics when appropriate.</SH3>

<Body>Some people may choose to use a gender-neutral title (such as Mx.). If you’re writing content about (or addressed to) a real person, and your style requires you to include a title, ask the person what title they use. If you can’t ask them, consider adopting a style that refers to people using only their name.</Body>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_8944">Writing about disability</H2>

<Nav2/>

<Body>When you write about people with disabilities, keep the focus on talents, skills, and accomplishments—just as you would for anyone you write about. You may not even need to mention someone’s disability unless it’s essential to the content; if you do refer to someone’s disability, follow the guidelines below.</Body>

<SH3>Put people first.</SH3>

<Body>In most cases, use people-first language when referring to people with disabilities. This means describing and talking about individuals as people before mentioning any disability they may have.</Body>

<Example>Avoid: Blind people</Example>

<Example>Preferable: People who are blind or have low vision</Example>

<Example>Avoid: A wheelchair-bound person</Example>

<Example>Preferable: A person in a wheelchair, a person who uses a wheelchair</Example>

<Body>Note: Members of some disability communities may consider their disabilities to be part of their identity, so they choose language that places an emphasis on culture first. For example, some people may prefer disabled to a person with a disability, or Deaf to a person who is deaf. When writing about specific individuals, always ask them how they prefer to be identified. See 
<Link>A guide to terms about disability</Link>
, below.</Body>

<SH3>Acknowledge a wide range of disability.</SH3>

<Body>It’s helpful to think about disability on a spectrum. For example, with blindness, there’s a wide range of vision differences—from people who are born blind, to those with low vision, to others with loss of vision in certain areas, such as peripheral vision. In addition, some people may have multiple disabilities.</Body>

<SH3>Write about people with disabilities as you would about anyone.</SH3>

<Body>When you write about a person with a disability, focus on their life, their personality and interests, or what they’ve created or accomplished—aside from their disability. Don’t treat disability as something to overcome, and don’t describe people with disabilities as brave, courageous, or inspiring. In general, people with disabilities want to be treated like everyone else.</Body>

<SH3>Avoid language that refers to using specific senses.</SH3>

<Body>When writing instructions (such as in training manuals or user guides), avoid using phrases that refer to the use of specific senses, like you see a message, you see a flashing light, or you hear an alert sound. Instead, simply describe what happens: A message appears, 
a light flashes, an alert sound plays.</Body>

<Body>Also avoid using idioms that send negative messages about disability—for example, that’s crazy, fell on deaf ears, or turned a blind eye to.</Body>

<SH3>Some phrases and idioms are OK.</SH3>

<Body>It’s OK to use commonly understood phrases such as the ones below:</Body>

<Example>I see your point.</Example>

<Example>You can watch your favorite movies on the Apple TV app.</Example>

<Example>Hear about the latest news right when it happens.</Example>

<Example>Don’t hesitate to speak your mind.</Example>

<Body>Even if people in your audience can’t see, hear, or speak, they’ll typically understand the intent of the words.</Body>

<Body>It’s also OK to use the common cross-reference See when linking to other material 
(for example, See the Apple Support article “Set up Family Sharing”).</Body>

<SH3>A guide to terms about disability</SH3>

<Body>Use the table below as a general guide when writing about disability.</Body>

<Body>Note: Members of some disability communities may consider their disabilities to be part 
of their identity, so they choose language that places an emphasis on culture first. When you write about specific people with disabilities, be sure to find out how they prefer to 
be identified.</Body>

<Nav1/>

<H2>Units of measure overview</H2>

<Nav2/>

<Body>This chapter provides usage guidelines for units of measure and lists abbreviations and symbols for frequently used units.</Body>

<Body>Follow these guidelines when you use units of measure in documentation:</Body>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>When to spell out: In user documentation, spell out units of measure and give the abbreviation in parentheses on first occurrence. Repeat the spelled-out version in new sections and chapters if the unit symbol or abbreviation is obscure and if the audience requires it.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<Example>20 gigabytes (GB) of memory</Example>

<Example>Subsequent occurrences: 20 GB of memory</Example>

<List_body_1>Always spell out nonmetric units of measure in text (for example, 17-inch display). It’s OK to abbreviate such units in tables and technical specifications (Display size: 17 in.).</List_body_1>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Noun: When you use a unit symbol or abbreviation as a noun, insert a space between the number and the abbreviation, and use the preposition of before the unit the 
value quantifies.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<Example>20 GB of memory</Example>

<List_body_1>Note that Apple Marketing Communications style for many abbreviations is to close up the number and the abbreviation (20GB of memory).</List_body_1>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Adjective: When you use a spelled-out unit of measure in a compound adjective, hyphenate the compound.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<Example>17-inch display</Example>

<Example>3-meter cable</Example>

<List_body_1>When you use a unit symbol or abbreviation in a compound adjective, don’t hyphenate; add a space between the number and the abbreviation.</List_body_1>

<Example>20 nA battery</Example>

<Example>30 GB capacity</Example>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Capitalization: With the exception of degrees Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Rankine, units of measure derived from a proper name aren’t capitalized when spelled out, but their unit symbols are capitalized. (For example, the unit symbol for joule is J.)</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Plurals: Unit symbols and abbreviations are unaltered in the plural forms (for example, lb., not lbs.).</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>International System of Units: Use the unit symbol for units of the International System of Units (SI) after first occurrence. If the unit symbol for meter could be confused with another term in your document, spell out meter.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<Example>The maximum size for a memory card is 35 mm.</Example>

<Example>The Ethernet cable is 40 meters long.</Example>

<List_body_1>Don’t use a period after an SI unit (unless the unit appears at the end of a sentence).</List_body_1>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Mixing symbols and names: Don’t mix unit symbols and names (m/second) or unit symbols and abbreviations (J/sec.). Don’t mix a prefix name with a unit symbol (kiloHz), or a prefix symbol with a unit name (khertz).</LBody>

<H1 id="LinkTarget_9006">Technical notation</H1>

<Nav1/>

<H2>Technical notation overview</H2>

<Nav2/>

<Body>This chapter gives special style and usage rules that apply largely or exclusively to developer documentation.</Body>

<Body>When writing about a particular programming language, be careful to follow the capitalization style of that language.</Body>

<H2>Code</H2>

<Nav2/>

<Body>Use code font for code.</Body>

<Body>Develop a method of spacing around punctuation and use the method consistently. It’s often best to use “English-style” spacing (one space character between words) because it’s easy to remember and to stick with.</Body>

<Example>(height, width: extended; quo: integer); PageSize = 1024</Example>

<H2>Syntax descriptions</H2>

<Nav2/>

<Body>Use code font for literals (parts of the language, values, and so on), italics for placeholder names, and regular text for the brackets that enclose something that’s optional. Pay close attention to punctuation.</Body>

<Example>Read ([file, ] var)</Example>

<Body>Use embedded caps to connect words that act as a single placeholder name (sourceFile).</Body>

<Body>Be consistent when naming placeholders; for example, don’t alternate between commands and commandList.</Body>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_9023">Code font in text</H2>

<Nav2/>

<Body>Most developer documentation uses code font for computer-language elements in text. Whether to use code font in text for other documents is a matter of judgment.</Body>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Use code font for all text fragments that represent expressions in a programming language.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Use code font for names of files, volumes, directories, and libraries.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<Example>StandardCRuntime.o library</Example>

<Example>MainProg.c file</Example>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Don’t use a function or method name as a verb.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<Example>Correct: Run ls on both directories.</Example>

<Example>Incorrect: ls both directories.</Example>

<Example>Correct: Use cd to change to the root directory.</Example>

<Example>Incorrect: cd to the root directory.</Example>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Don’t mix fonts within a single word. Rewrite to avoid forming the plural of a word in code font.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<Example>Correct: values of type integer</Example>

<Example>Incorrect: integers</Example>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Use regular text font, not code font, for punctuation following a word or phrase in code font, unless the punctuation mark is part of the computer-language element represented.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<Example>NAN(004), nan(4), and NaN are examples of acceptable input.</Example>

<H2>Placeholder names in text</H2>

<Nav2/>

<Body>In running text, use italics when referring to a placeholder name (that is, an artificial term that has meaning only in your documentation and is to be replaced by a value or symbol). Spell the name just as it would appear in a syntax description. Don’t use a placeholder as you would use a regular English term.</Body>

<Example>Correct: Replace volumeName with a name of up to 12 characters.</Example>

<Example>Correct: The volume name can be up to 12 characters long.</Example>

<Example>Incorrect: The volumeName can be up to 12 characters long.</Example>

<Body>Avoid foo, bar, and baz to represent hierarchical or ordered placeholder names in code examples. Instead, use names that suggest the kind of item.</Body>

<Example>TObject.FirstMethod</Example>

<Example>TObject.SecondMethod</Example>

<Body/>

<H1 id="LinkTarget_9049">International style</H1>

<Nav1/>

<H2>International style overview</H2>

<Nav2/>

<Body>Following international style helps readers with limited English proficiency read what you write. By following international style, you also help translators—human or machine—localize your writing by minimizing the burdens of cultural and customary language usage.</Body>

<Body>Writing in the international style means that you write simply and that you express yourself using standard international conventions. These are the basic rules:</Body>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Write in simple structures.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Don’t use idiomatic or colloquial expressions.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Avoid shortcuts, symbols, and abbreviations that could easily be spelled out.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Express data using the standard international conventions outlined in this chapter. You should vary from these standards only when there’s a truly compelling advantage in using a proprietary or customary style.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<Body>For more information about standard international conventions, visit the websites listed in this chapter.</Body>

<LBody>Rationale: Date and time formats are represented with the largest units given first. From left to right the ranking is year, month, week, day, hour, minute, second.

<LBody>Usage: Dates are expressed numerically as year, month, day and are separated by a hyphen. Times are expressed on a 24-hour clock. A colon separates hours, minutes, and seconds. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) times are expressed as “Z.” Local time zones are expressed as the number of hours from UTC.</LBody>

<Nav2/>

<Body>Decimals are expressed by a period or comma. For numbers larger than 999, don’t 
use a period or comma as a separator. A nonbreaking space (Option-Space bar) may 
be used instead.</Body>

<LBody>Rationale: Breaking up large numbers makes them easier to read, especially in tables. 
A nonbreaking space can’t be misinterpreted as a decimal marker.</LBody>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Usage: Use a period to produce a decimal in English. Numbers may be divided in groups of three on either side of the decimal to make them easy to read. Use a nonbreaking space instead of a period or comma to divide numbers. Express large numbers in their smallest form to make them easier to read.</LBody>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_9093">Telephone numbers</H2>

<Nav2/>

<Body>Telephone numbers begin with the plus sign and are followed by the country code, the city code, and the number. Freephone (toll-free) numbers are expressed in the local style. Always give a toll number if one is available.</Body>

<LBody>Standard: ITU-T E.123</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Rationale: The plus sign (+) represents any number a caller must dial to get an outside line, like 9. The caller then dials the remaining digits. Freephone numbers are usually impossible to dial globally, even between Canada and the United States. Providing a freephone number with a toll number allows customers to call no matter where 
they’re from.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>•	</Lbl>

<LBody>Usage: Telephone number notations begin with the plus sign and are followed by the country code, the city code, and the number. Breaks in national numbering plans may be represented by a space. Toll-free numbers are expressed in the local style.</LBody>

<Example>You can reach Apple France by calling +33 1 69 86 34 00 or 
0800 046 046.</Example>

<H2>Units of measure</H2>

<Nav2/>

<Body>Use only units of the International System of Units (SI) to express the values of quantities. Equivalent values in nonmetric units may be given in parentheses following SI values in cases where safety may be an issue, or when they’re used in a product’s name.</Body>

<LBody>Usage: Quantities are always expressed with a unit symbol. Use a nonbreaking space (Option-Space bar) between the quantity and its symbol. Unit symbols are unaltered in the plural, and are never hyphenated, even when they’re used as an adjective. Unit symbols aren’t followed by a period unless they appear at the end of a sentence. Don’t imply more precision than is reasonable in choosing a unit symbol.</LBody>
